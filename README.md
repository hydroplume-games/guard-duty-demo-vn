This is the repository containing the Ren'Py scripts and assets used to produce Guard Duty VN

### What is Guard Duty VN?
Guard Duty VN is an adaptation of the eponymous SCP Article / Fan Work. The original "Guard Duty" written by Dmatix and can be found on the [SCP Foundation Website](http://www.scp-wiki.net/guard-duty).

This adaptation also serves two other purposes:
1. To serve as an accessory piece to a much larger SCP Fan Game ([DDLC Lost Control](https://aminoapps.com/c/ddlc/page/blog/doki-doki-lost-control-scp-crossover-mod-fan-game-teaser/o31Y_VKmtduoeLxDbRQjD23QGZav4XGxpJ)).

2. To demonstrate the Ren'Py based RPG/Overworld Engine that will be a main feature of this game.

This project is just getting underway, so nothing is in any real state to be played; however, comments, questions, and concerns are always welcome! Check out our Amino site for more details. Let us know if you want to help out to contribute!
